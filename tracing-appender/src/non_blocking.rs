//! A non-blocking, off-thread writer.
//!
//! This spawns a dedicated worker thread which is responsible for writing log
//! lines to the provided writer. When a line is written using the returned
//! `NonBlocking` struct's `make_writer` method, it will be enqueued to be
//! written by the worker thread.
//!
//! The queue has a fixed capacity, and if it becomes full, any logs written
//! to it will be dropped until capacity is once again available. This may
//! occur if logs are consistently produced faster than the worker thread can
//! output them. The queue capacity and behavior when full (i.e., whether to
//! drop logs or to exert backpressure to slow down senders) can be configured
//! using [`NonBlockingBuilder::default()`][builder].
//! This function returns the default configuration. It is equivalent to:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use tracing_appender::non_blocking::{NonBlocking, WorkerGuard};
//! # fn doc() -> (NonBlocking, WorkerGuard) {
//! tracing_appender::non_blocking(std::io::stdout())
//! # }
//! ```
//! [builder]: NonBlockingBuilder::default()
//!
//! <br/> This function returns a tuple of `NonBlocking` and `WorkerGuard`.
//! `NonBlocking` implements [`MakeWriter`] which integrates with `tracing_subscriber`.
//! `WorkerGuard` is a drop guard that is responsible for flushing any remaining logs when
//! the program terminates.
//!
//! Note that the `WorkerGuard` returned by `non_blocking` _must_ be assigned to a binding that
//! is not `_`, as `_` will result in the `WorkerGuard` being dropped immediately.
//! Unintentional drops of `WorkerGuard` remove the guarantee that logs will be flushed
//! during a program's termination, in a panic or otherwise.
//!
//! See [`WorkerGuard`][worker_guard] for examples of using the guard.
//!
//! [worker_guard]: WorkerGuard
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ``` rust
//! # fn docs() {
//! let (non_blocking, _guard) = tracing_appender::non_blocking(std::io::stdout());
//! let collector = tracing_subscriber::fmt().with_writer(non_blocking);
//! tracing::collect::with_default(collector.finish(), || {
//!    tracing::event!(tracing::Level::INFO, "Hello");
//! });
//! # }
//! ```
