//! Callsites represent the source locations from which spans or events
//! originate.
//!
//! # What Are Callsites?
//!
//! Every span or event in `tracing` is associated with a [`Callsite`]. A
//! callsite is a small `static` value that is responsible for the following:
//!
//! * Storing the span or event's [`Metadata`],
//! * Uniquely [identifying](Identifier) the span or event definition,
//! * Caching the collector's [`Interest`][^1] in that span or event, to avoid
//!   re-evaluating filters,
//! * Storing a [`Registration`] that allows the callsite to be part of a global
//!   list of all callsites in the program.
//!
//! # Registering Callsites
//!
//! When a span or event is recorded for the first time, its callsite
//! [`register`]s itself with the global callsite registry. Registering a
//! callsite calls the [`Collect::register_callsite`][`register_callsite`]
//! method with that callsite's [`Metadata`] on every currently active
//! collector. This serves two primary purposes: informing collectors of the
//! callsite's existence, and performing static filtering.
//!
//! ## Callsite Existence
//!
//! If a [`Collect`] implementation wishes to allocate storage for each
//! unique span/event location in the program, or pre-compute some value
//! that will be used to record that span or event in the future, it can
//! do so in its [`register_callsite`] method.
//!
//! ## Performing Static Filtering
//!
//! The [`register_callsite`] method returns an [`Interest`] value,
//! which indicates that the collector either [always] wishes to record
//! that span or event, [sometimes] wishes to record it based on a
//! dynamic filter evaluation, or [never] wishes to record it.
//!
//! When registering a new callsite, the [`Interest`]s returned by every
//! currently active collector are combined, and the result is stored at
//! each callsite. This way, when the span or event occurs in the
//! future, the cached [`Interest`] value can be checked efficiently
//! to determine if the span or event should be recorded, without
//! needing to perform expensive filtering (i.e. calling the
//! [`Collect::enabled`] method every time a span or event occurs).
//!
//! ### Rebuilding Cached Interest
//!
//! When a new [`Dispatch`] is created (i.e. a new collector becomes
//! active), any previously cached [`Interest`] values are re-evaluated
//! for all callsites in the program. This way, if the new collector
//! will enable a callsite that was not previously enabled, the
//! [`Interest`] in that callsite is updated. Similarly, when a
//! collector is dropped, the interest cache is also re-evaluated, so
//! that any callsites enabled only by that collector are disabled.
//!
//! In addition, the [`rebuild_interest_cache`] function in this module can be
//! used to manually invalidate all cached interest and re-register those
//! callsites. This function is useful in situations where a collector's
//! interest can change, but it does so relatively infrequently. The collector
//! may wish for its interest to be cached most of the time, and return
//! [`Interest::always`][always] or [`Interest::never`][never] in its
//! [`register_callsite`] method, so that its [`Collect::enabled`] method
//! doesn't need to be evaluated every time a span or event is recorded.
//! However, when the configuration changes, the collector can call
//! [`rebuild_interest_cache`] to re-evaluate the entire interest cache with its
//! new configuration. This is a relatively costly operation, but if the
//! configuration changes infrequently, it may be more efficient than calling
//! [`Collect::enabled`] frequently.
//!
