//! The [`Layer`] trait, a composable abstraction for building [`Subscriber`]s.
//!
//! The [`Subscriber`] trait in `tracing-core` represents the _complete_ set of
//! functionality required to consume `tracing` instrumentation. This means that
//! a single `Subscriber` instance is a self-contained implementation of a
//! complete strategy for collecting traces; but it _also_ means that the
//! `Subscriber` trait cannot easily be composed with other `Subscriber`s.
//!
//! In particular, [`Subscriber`]s are responsible for generating [span IDs] and
//! assigning them to spans. Since these IDs must uniquely identify a span
//! within the context of the current trace, this means that there may only be
//! a single `Subscriber` for a given thread at any point in time &mdash;
//! otherwise, there would be no authoritative source of span IDs.
//!
//! On the other hand, the majority of the [`Subscriber`] trait's functionality
//! is composable: any number of subscribers may _observe_ events, span entry
//! and exit, and so on, provided that there is a single authoritative source of
//! span IDs. The [`Layer`] trait represents this composable subset of the
//! [`Subscriber`] behavior; it can _observe_ events and spans, but does not
//! assign IDs.
//!
//! # Composing Layers
//!
//! Since a [`Layer`] does not implement a complete strategy for collecting
//! traces, it must be composed with a `Subscriber` in order to be used. The
//! [`Layer`] trait is generic over a type parameter (called `S` in the trait
//! definition), representing the types of `Subscriber` they can be composed
//! with. Thus, a [`Layer`] may be implemented that will only compose with a
//! particular `Subscriber` implementation, or additional trait bounds may be
//! added to constrain what types implementing `Subscriber` a `Layer` can wrap.
//!
//! `Layer`s may be added to a `Subscriber` by using the [`SubscriberExt::with`]
//! method, which is provided by `tracing-subscriber`'s [prelude]. This method
//! returns a [`Layered`] struct that implements `Subscriber` by composing the
//! `Layer` with the `Subscriber`.
//!
//! For example:
//! ```rust
//! use tracing_subscriber::Layer;
//! use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;
//! use tracing::Subscriber;
//!
//! pub struct MyLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! impl<S: Subscriber> Layer<S> for MyLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! pub struct MySubscriber {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! # use tracing_core::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata, Event};
//! impl Subscriber for MySubscriber {
//!     // ...
//! #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(1) }
//! #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}
//! #   fn event(&self, _: &Event) {}
//! #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! }
//! # impl MyLayer {
//! # fn new() -> Self { Self {} }
//! # }
//! # impl MySubscriber {
//! # fn new() -> Self { Self { }}
//! # }
//!
//! let subscriber = MySubscriber::new()
//!     .with(MyLayer::new());
//!
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber);
//! ```
//!
//! Multiple `Layer`s may be composed in the same manner:
//! ```rust
//! # use tracing_subscriber::{Layer, layer::SubscriberExt};
//! # use tracing::Subscriber;
//! pub struct MyOtherLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! impl<S: Subscriber> Layer<S> for MyOtherLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! pub struct MyThirdLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! impl<S: Subscriber> Layer<S> for MyThirdLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! # pub struct MyLayer {}
//! # impl<S: Subscriber> Layer<S> for MyLayer {}
//! # pub struct MySubscriber { }
//! # use tracing_core::{span::{Id, Attributes, Record}, Metadata, Event};
//! # impl Subscriber for MySubscriber {
//! #   fn new_span(&self, _: &Attributes) -> Id { Id::from_u64(1) }
//! #   fn record(&self, _: &Id, _: &Record) {}
//! #   fn event(&self, _: &Event) {}
//! #   fn record_follows_from(&self, _: &Id, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn enabled(&self, _: &Metadata) -> bool { false }
//! #   fn enter(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! #   fn exit(&self, _: &Id) {}
//! }
//! # impl MyLayer {
//! # fn new() -> Self { Self {} }
//! # }
//! # impl MyOtherLayer {
//! # fn new() -> Self { Self {} }
//! # }
//! # impl MyThirdLayer {
//! # fn new() -> Self { Self {} }
//! # }
//! # impl MySubscriber {
//! # fn new() -> Self { Self { }}
//! # }
//!
//! let subscriber = MySubscriber::new()
//!     .with(MyLayer::new())
//!     .with(MyOtherLayer::new())
//!     .with(MyThirdLayer::new());
//!
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber);
//! ```
//!
//! The [`Layer::with_subscriber`] constructs the [`Layered`] type from a
//! [`Layer`] and [`Subscriber`], and is called by [`SubscriberExt::with`]. In
//! general, it is more idiomatic to use [`SubscriberExt::with`], and treat
//! [`Layer::with_subscriber`] as an implementation detail, as `with_subscriber`
//! calls must be nested, leading to less clear code for the reader.
//!
//! ## Runtime Configuration With `Layer`s
//!
//! In some cases, a particular [`Layer`] may be enabled or disabled based on
//! runtime configuration. This can introduce challenges, because the type of a
//! layered [`Subscriber`] depends on which layers are added to it: if an `if`
//! or `match` expression adds some [`Layer`] implementation in one branch,
//! and other layers in another, the [`Subscriber`] values returned by those
//! branches will have different types. For example, the following _will not_
//! work:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # fn docs() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + 'static>> {
//! # struct Config {
//! #    is_prod: bool,
//! #    path: &'static str,
//! # }
//! # let cfg = Config { is_prod: false, path: "debug.log" };
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use tracing_subscriber::{Registry, prelude::*};
//!
//! let stdout_log = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer().pretty();
//! let subscriber = Registry::default().with(stdout_log);
//!
//! // The compile error will occur here because the if and else
//! // branches have different (and therefore incompatible) types.
//! let subscriber = if cfg.is_prod {
//!     let file = File::create(cfg.path)?;
//!     let layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
//!         .json()
//!         .with_writer(Arc::new(file));
//!     layer.with(subscriber)
//! } else {
//!     layer
//! };
//!
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber)
//!     .expect("Unable to set global subscriber");
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! However, a [`Layer`] wrapped in an [`Option`] [also implements the `Layer`
//! trait][option-impl]. This allows individual layers to be enabled or disabled at
//! runtime while always producing a [`Subscriber`] of the same type. For
//! example:
//!
//! ```
//! # fn docs() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + 'static>> {
//! # struct Config {
//! #    is_prod: bool,
//! #    path: &'static str,
//! # }
//! # let cfg = Config { is_prod: false, path: "debug.log" };
//! use std::fs::File;
//! use tracing_subscriber::{Registry, prelude::*};
//!
//! let stdout_log = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer().pretty();
//! let subscriber = Registry::default().with(stdout_log);
//!
//! // if `cfg.is_prod` is true, also log JSON-formatted logs to a file.
//! let json_log = if cfg.is_prod {
//!     let file = File::create(cfg.path)?;
//!     let json_log = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
//!         .json()
//!         .with_writer(file);
//!     Some(json_log)
//! } else {
//!     None
//! };
//!
//! // If `cfg.is_prod` is false, then `json` will be `None`, and this layer
//! // will do nothing. However, the subscriber will still have the same type
//! // regardless of whether the `Option`'s value is `None` or `Some`.
//! let subscriber = subscriber.with(json_log);
//!
//! tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber)
//!    .expect("Unable to set global subscriber");
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! If a [`Layer`] may be one of several different types, note that [`Box<dyn
//! Layer<S> + Send + Sync>` implements `Layer`][box-impl].
//! This may be used to erase the type of a [`Layer`].
//!
//! For example, a function that configures a [`Layer`] to log to one of
//! several outputs might return a `Box<dyn Layer<S> + Send + Sync + 'static>`:
//! ```
//! use tracing_subscriber::{
//!     Layer,
//!     registry::LookupSpan,
//!     prelude::*,
//! };
//! use std::{path::PathBuf, fs::File, io};
//!
//! /// Configures whether logs are emitted to a file, to stdout, or to stderr.
//! pub enum LogConfig {
//!     File(PathBuf),
//!     Stdout,
//!     Stderr,
//! }
//!
//! impl LogConfig {
//!     pub fn layer<S>(self) -> Box<dyn Layer<S> + Send + Sync + 'static>
//!     where
//!         S: tracing_core::Subscriber,
//!         for<'a> S: LookupSpan<'a>,
//!     {
//!         // Shared configuration regardless of where logs are output to.
//!         let fmt = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
//!             .with_target(true)
//!             .with_thread_names(true);
//!
//!         // Configure the writer based on the desired log target:
//!         match self {
//!             LogConfig::File(path) => {
//!                 let file = File::create(path).expect("failed to create log file");
//!                 Box::new(fmt.with_writer(file))
//!             },
//!             LogConfig::Stdout => Box::new(fmt.with_writer(io::stdout)),
//!             LogConfig::Stderr => Box::new(fmt.with_writer(io::stderr)),
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let config = LogConfig::Stdout;
//! tracing_subscriber::registry()
//!     .with(config.layer())
//!     .init();
//! ```
//!
//! The [`Layer::boxed`] method is provided to make boxing a `Layer`
//! more convenient, but [`Box::new`] may be used as well.
//!
//! When the number of `Layer`s varies at runtime, note that a
//! [`Vec<L> where L: Layer` also implements `Layer`][vec-impl]. This
//! can be used to add a variable number of `Layer`s to a `Subscriber`:
//!
//! ```
//! use tracing_subscriber::{Layer, prelude::*};
//! struct MyLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//! # impl MyLayer { fn new() -> Self { Self {} }}
//!
//! impl<S: tracing_core::Subscriber> Layer<S> for MyLayer {
//!     // ...
//! }
//!
//! /// Returns how many layers we need
//! fn how_many_layers() -> usize {
//!     // ...
//!     # 3
//! }
//!
//! // Create a variable-length `Vec` of layers
//! let mut layers = Vec::new();
//! for _ in 0..how_many_layers() {
//!     layers.push(MyLayer::new());
//! }
//!
//! tracing_subscriber::registry()
//!     .with(layers)
//!     .init();
//! ```
//!
//! If a variable number of `Layer` is needed and those `Layer`s have
//! different types, a `Vec` of [boxed `Layer` trait objects][box-impl] may
//! be used. For example:
//!
//! ```
//! use tracing_subscriber::{filter::LevelFilter, Layer, prelude::*};
//! use std::fs::File;
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! struct Config {
//!     enable_log_file: bool,
//!     enable_stdout: bool,
//!     enable_stderr: bool,
//!     // ...
//! }
//! # impl Config {
//! #    fn from_config_file()-> Result<Self, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! #         // don't enable the log file so that the example doesn't actually create it
//! #         Ok(Self { enable_log_file: false, enable_stdout: true, enable_stderr: true })
//! #    }
//! # }
//!
//! let cfg = Config::from_config_file()?;
//!
//! // Based on our dynamically loaded config file, create any number of layers:
//! let mut layers = Vec::new();
//!
//! if cfg.enable_log_file {
//!     let file = File::create("myapp.log")?;
//!     let layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
//!         .with_thread_names(true)
//!         .with_target(true)
//!         .json()
//!         .with_writer(file)
//!         // Box the layer as a type-erased trait object, so that it can
//!         // be pushed to the `Vec`.
//!         .boxed();
//!     layers.push(layer);
//! }
//!
//! if cfg.enable_stdout {
//!     let layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
//!         .pretty()
//!         .with_filter(LevelFilter::INFO)
//!         // Box the layer as a type-erased trait object, so that it can
//!         // be pushed to the `Vec`.
//!         .boxed();
//!     layers.push(layer);
//! }
//!
//! if cfg.enable_stdout {
//!     let layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
//!         .with_target(false)
//!         .with_filter(LevelFilter::WARN)
//!         // Box the layer as a type-erased trait object, so that it can

//! }
//!
//! tracing_subscriber::registry()
//!     .with(layers)
//!     .init();
//!# Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! Finally, if the number of layers _changes_ at runtime, a `Vec` of
//! subscribers can be used alongside the [`reload`](crate::reload) module to
//! add or remove subscribers dynamically at runtime.

//!
//! # Recording Traces
//!
//! The [`Layer`] trait defines a set of methods for consuming notifications from
//! tracing instrumentation, which are generally equivalent to the similarly
//! named methods on [`Subscriber`]. Unlike [`Subscriber`], the methods on
//! `Layer` are additionally passed a [`Context`] type, which exposes additional
//! information provided by the wrapped subscriber (such as [the current span])
//! to the layer.
//!
//! # Filtering with `Layer`s
//!
//! As well as strategies for handling trace events, the `Layer` trait may also
//! be used to represent composable _filters_. This allows the determination of
//! what spans and events should be recorded to be decoupled from _how_ they are
//! recorded: a filtering layer can be applied to other layers or
//! subscribers. `Layer`s can be used to implement _global filtering_, where a
//! `Layer` provides a filtering strategy for the entire subscriber.
//! Additionally, individual recording `Layer`s or sets of `Layer`s may be
//! combined with _per-layer filters_ that control what spans and events are
//! recorded by those layers.
//!
//! ## Global Filtering
//!
//! A `Layer` that implements a filtering strategy should override the
//! [`register_callsite`] and/or [`enabled`] methods. It may also choose to implement
//! methods such as [`on_enter`], if it wishes to filter trace events based on
//! the current span context.
//!
//! Note that the [`Layer::register_callsite`] and [`Layer::enabled`] methods
//! determine whether a span or event is enabled *globally*. Thus, they should
//! **not** be used to indicate whether an individual layer wishes to record a
//! particular span or event. Instead, if a layer is only interested in a subset
//! of trace data, but does *not* wish to disable other spans and events for the
//! rest of the layer stack should ignore those spans and events in its
//! notification methods.
//!
//! The filtering methods on a stack of `Layer`s are evaluated in a top-down
//! order, starting with the outermost `Layer` and ending with the wrapped
//! [`Subscriber`]. If any layer returns `false` from its [`enabled`] method, or
//! [`Interest::never()`] from its [`register_callsite`] method, filter
//! evaluation will short-circuit and the span or event will be disabled.
//!
//! ### Enabling Interest
//!
//! Whenever an tracing event (or span) is emitted, it goes through a number of
//! steps to determine how and how much it should be processed. The earlier an
//! event is disabled, the less work has to be done to process the event, so
//! `Layer`s that implement filtering should attempt to disable unwanted
//! events as early as possible. In order, each event checks:
//!
//! - [`register_callsite`], once per callsite (roughly: once per time that
//!   `event!` or `span!` is written in the source code; this is cached at the
//!   callsite). See [`Subscriber::register_callsite`] and
//!   [`tracing_core::callsite`] for a summary of how this behaves.
//! - [`enabled`], once per emitted event (roughly: once per time that `event!`
//!   or `span!` is *executed*), and only if `register_callsite` registers an
//!   [`Interest::sometimes`]. This is the main customization point to globally
//!   filter events based on their [`Metadata`]. If an event can be disabled
//!   based only on [`Metadata`], it should be, as this allows the construction
//!   of the actual `Event`/`Span` to be skipped.
//! - For events only (and not spans), [`event_enabled`] is called just before
//!   processing the event. This gives layers one last chance to say that
//!   an event should be filtered out, now that the event's fields are known.
//!
//! ## Per-Layer Filtering
//!
//! **Note**: per-layer filtering APIs currently require the [`"registry"` crate
//! feature flag][feat] to be enabled.
//!
//! Sometimes, it may be desirable for one `Layer` to record a particular subset
//! of spans and events, while a different subset of spans and events are
//! recorded by other `Layer`s. For example:
//!
//! - A layer that records metrics may wish to observe only events including
//!   particular tracked values, while a logging layer ignores those events.
//! - If recording a distributed trace is expensive, it might be desirable to
//!   only send spans with `INFO` and lower verbosity to the distributed tracing
//!   system, while logging more verbose spans to a file.
//! - Spans and events with a particular target might be recorded differently
//!   from others, such as by generating an HTTP access log from a span that
//!   tracks the lifetime of an HTTP request.
//!
//! The [`Filter`] trait is used to control what spans and events are
//! observed by an individual `Layer`, while still allowing other `Layer`s to
//! potentially record them. The [`Layer::with_filter`] method combines a
//! `Layer` with a [`Filter`], returning a [`Filtered`] layer.
//!
//! This crate's [`filter`] module provides a number of types which implement
//! the [`Filter`] trait, such as [`LevelFilter`], [`Targets`], and
//! [`FilterFn`]. These [`Filter`]s provide ready-made implementations of
//! common forms of filtering. For custom filtering policies, the [`FilterFn`]
//! and [`DynFilterFn`] types allow implementing a [`Filter`] with a closure or
//! function pointer. In addition, when more control is required, the [`Filter`]
//! trait may also be implemented for user-defined types.
//!
//! //! [`Option<Filter>`] also implements [`Filter`], which allows for an optional
//! filter. [`None`](Option::None) filters out _nothing_ (that is, allows
//! everything through). For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use tracing_subscriber::{filter::filter_fn, Layer};
//! # use tracing_core::{Metadata, subscriber::Subscriber};
//! # struct MyLayer<S>(std::marker::PhantomData<S>);
//! # impl<S> MyLayer<S> { fn new() -> Self { Self(std::marker::PhantomData)} }
//! # impl<S: Subscriber> Layer<S> for MyLayer<S> {}
//! # fn my_filter(_: &str) -> impl Fn(&Metadata) -> bool { |_| true  }
//! fn setup_tracing<S: Subscriber>(filter_config: Option<&str>) {
//!     let layer = MyLayer::<S>::new()
//!         .with_filter(filter_config.map(|config| filter_fn(my_filter(config))));
//! //...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! <pre class="compile_fail" style="white-space:normal;font:inherit;">
//!     <strong>Warning</strong>: Currently, the <a href="../struct.Registry.html">
//!     <code>Registry</code></a> type defined in this crate is the only root
//!     <code>Subscriber</code> capable of supporting <code>Layer</code>s with
//!     per-layer filters. In the future, new APIs will be added to allow other
//!     root <code>Subscriber</code>s to support per-layer filters.
//! </pre>
//!
//! For example, to generate an HTTP access log based on spans with
//! the `http_access` target, while logging other spans and events to
//! standard out, a [`Filter`] can be added to the access log layer:
//!
//! ```
//! use tracing_subscriber::{filter, prelude::*};
//!
//! // Generates an HTTP access log.
//! let access_log = // ...
//!     # filter::LevelFilter::INFO;
//!
//! // Add a filter to the access log layer so that it only observes
//! // spans and events with the `http_access` target.
//! let access_log = access_log.with_filter(filter::filter_fn(|metadata| {
//!     // Returns `true` if and only if the span or event's target is
//!     // "http_access".
//!     metadata.target() == "http_access"
//! }));
//!
//! // A general-purpose logging layer.
//! let fmt_layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer();
//!
//! // Build a subscriber that combines the access log and stdout log
//! // layers.
//! tracing_subscriber::registry()
//!     .with(fmt_layer)
//!     .with(access_log)
//!     .init();
//! ```
//!
//! Multiple layers can have their own, separate per-layer filters. A span or
//! event will be recorded if it is enabled by _any_ per-layer filter, but it
//! will be skipped by the layers whose filters did not enable it. Building on
//! the previous example:
//!
//! ```
//! use tracing_subscriber::{filter::{filter_fn, LevelFilter}, prelude::*};
//!
//! let access_log = // ...
//!     # LevelFilter::INFO;
//! let fmt_layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer();
//!
//! tracing_subscriber::registry()
//!     // Add the filter for the "http_access" target to the access
//!     // log layer, like before.
//!     .with(access_log.with_filter(filter_fn(|metadata| {
//!         metadata.target() == "http_access"
//!     })))
//!     // Add a filter for spans and events with the INFO level
//!     // and below to the logging layer.
//!     .with(fmt_layer.with_filter(LevelFilter::INFO))
//!     .init();
//!
//! // Neither layer will observe this event
//! tracing::debug!(does_anyone_care = false, "a tree fell in the forest");
//!
//! // This event will be observed by the logging layer, but not
//! // by the access log layer.
//! tracing::warn!(dose_roentgen = %3.8, "not great, but not terrible");
//!
//! // This event will be observed only by the access log layer.
//! tracing::trace!(target: "http_access", "HTTP request started");
//!
//! // Both layers will observe this event.
//! tracing::error!(target: "http_access", "HTTP request failed with a very bad error!");
//! ```
//!
//! A per-layer filter can be applied to multiple [`Layer`]s at a time, by
//! combining them into a [`Layered`] layer using [`Layer::and_then`], and then
//! calling [`Layer::with_filter`] on the resulting [`Layered`] layer.
//!
//! Consider the following:
//! - `layer_a` and `layer_b`, which should only receive spans and events at
//!   the [`INFO`] [level] and above.
//! - A third layer, `layer_c`, which should receive spans and events at
//!   the [`DEBUG`] [level] as well.
//!
//! The layers and filters would be composed thusly:
//!
//! ```
//! use tracing_subscriber::{filter::LevelFilter, prelude::*};
//!
//! let layer_a = // ...
//! # LevelFilter::INFO;
//! let layer_b =  // ...
//! # LevelFilter::INFO;
//! let layer_c =  // ...
//! # LevelFilter::INFO;

//!     .with(layer_c.with_filter(LevelFilter::DEBUG))

//!```
//!
//! If a [`Filtered`] [`Layer`] is combined with another [`Layer`]
//! [`Layer::and_then`], and a filter is added to the [`Layered`] layer, that
//! layer will be filtered by *both* the inner filter and the outer filter.
//! Only spans and events that are enabled by *both* filters will be
//! observed by that layer. This can be used to implement complex filtering
//! trees.
//!
//! As an example, consider the following constraints:
//! - Suppose that a particular [target] is used to indicate events that
//!   should be counted as part of a metrics system, which should be only
//!   observed by a layer that collects metrics.
//! - A log of high-priority events ([`INFO`] and above) should be logged
//!   to stdout, while more verbose events should be logged to a debugging log file.
//! - Metrics-focused events should *not* be included in either log output.
//!
//! In that case, it is possible to apply a filter to both logging layers to
//! exclude the metrics events, while additionally adding a [`LevelFilter`]
//! to the stdout log:
//!
//! ```
//! # // wrap this in a function so we don't actually create `debug.log` when
//! # // running the doctests..
//! # fn docs() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + 'static>> {
//! use tracing_subscriber::{filter, prelude::*};
//! use std::{fs::File, sync::Arc};
//!
//! // A layer that logs events to stdout using the human-readable "pretty"
//! // format.
//! let stdout_log = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
//!     .pretty();

//! let file = File::create("debug.log")?;
//! let debug_log = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
