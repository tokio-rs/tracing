//! ## Per-Subscriber Filtering
//!
//! Per-subscriber filters permit individual `Subscribe`s to have their own filter
//! configurations without interfering with other `Subscribe`s.
//!
//! This module is not public; the public APIs defined in this module are
//! re-exported in the top-level `filter` module. Therefore, this documentation
//! primarily concerns the internal implementation details. For the user-facing
//! public API documentation, see the individual public types in this module, as
//! well as the, see the `Subscribe` trait documentation's [per-subscriber filtering
//! section]][1].
//!
//! ## How does per-subscriber filtering work?
//!
//! As described in the API documentation, the [`Filter`] trait defines a
//! filtering strategy for a per-subscriber filter. We expect there will be a variety
//! of implementations of [`Filter`], both in `tracing-subscriber` and in user
//! code.
//!
//! To actually *use* a [`Filter`] implementation, it is combined with a
//! [`Subscribe`] by the [`Filtered`] struct defined in this module. [`Filtered`]
//! implements [`Subscribe`] by calling into the wrapped [`Subscribe`], or not, based on
//! the filtering strategy. While there will be a variety of types that implement
//! [`Filter`], all actual *uses* of per-subscriber filtering will occur through the
//! [`Filtered`] struct. Therefore, most of the implementation details live
//! there.

///    span's per-span data. This allows `Filtered` subscribers to determine
///    whether they had previously disabled a given span, and avoid showing it
///    to the wrapped subscriber if it was disabled.
///
///    This allows `Filtered` subscribers to also filter out the spans they
///    disable from span traversals (such as iterating over parents, etc).
/// 2. If all the bits are set, then every per-subscriber filter has decided it
///    doesn't want to enable that span or event. In that case, the
///    `Registry`'s `enabled` method will return `false`, so that

    /// won't call the inner subscriber's `on_event` or `new_span` callbacks if it
    /// disabled the event/span.
    ///

    /// `FilterId`s as a number number that we shift a 1 over by to get a mask,
    /// we just store the actual mask,so we can combine them with a bitwise-OR.
    ///
    /// For example, if we consider the following case (pretending that the
    /// masks are 8 bits instead of 64 just so i don't have to write out a bunch
    /// of extra zeroes):
    ///
    /// - `filter1` has the filter id 1 (`0b0000_0001`)
    /// - `filter2` has the filter id 2 (`0b0000_0010`)
    ///
    /// A span that gets disabled by filter 1 would have the [`FilterMap`] with
    /// bits `0b0000_0001`.
    ///
    /// If the `FilterId` was internally represented as `(bits to shift + 1),
    /// when `subscriber2`'s [`Context`] checked if it enabled the  span, it would
    /// make the mask `0b0000_0010` (`1 << 1`). That bit would not be set in the
    /// [`FilterMap`], so it would see that it _didn't_ disable  the span. Which
    /// is *true*, it just doesn't reflect the tree-like shape of the actual
    /// subscriber.
    ///
    /// By having the IDs be masks instead of shifts, though, when the
