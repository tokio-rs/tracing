//! Utilities for implementing and composing [`tracing`] subscribers.
//!
//! [`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
//! scoped, structured, and async-aware diagnostics. The [`Collect`] trait
//! represents the functionality necessary to collect this trace data. This
//! crate contains tools for composing subscribers out of smaller units of
//! behaviour, and batteries-included implementations of common subscriber
//! functionality.
//!
//! `tracing-subscriber` is intended for use by both `Collector` authors and
//! application authors using `tracing` to instrument their applications.
//!
//! *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.42+][msrv]*
//!
//! [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions
//!
//! ## Included Subscribers
//!
//! The following `Collector`s are provided for application authors:
//!
//! - [`fmt`] - Formats and logs tracing data (requires the `fmt` feature flag)
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! - `env-filter`: Enables the [`EnvFilter`] type, which implements filtering
//!   similar to the [`env_logger` crate]. Enabled by default.
//! - `fmt`: Enables the [`fmt`] module, which provides a subscriber
//!   implementation for printing formatted representations of trace events.
//!   Enabled by default.
//! - `ansi`: Enables `fmt` support for ANSI terminal colors. Enabled by
//!   default.
//! - `registry`: enables the [`registry`] module. Enabled by default.
//! - `json`: Enables `fmt` support for JSON output. In JSON output, the ANSI feature does nothing.
//!
//! ### Optional Dependencies
//!
//! - [`tracing-log`]: Enables better formatting for events emitted by `log`
//!   macros in the `fmt` subscriber. On by default.
//! - [`chrono`]: Enables human-readable time formatting in the `fmt` subscriber.
//!   Enabled by default.
//! - [`smallvec`]: Causes the `EnvFilter` type to use the `smallvec` crate (rather
//!   than `Vec`) as a performance optimization. Enabled by default.
//! - [`parking_lot`]: Use the `parking_lot` crate's `RwLock` implementation
//!   rather than the Rust standard library's implementation.
//!
//! ## Supported Rust Versions
//!
//! Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
//! version is 1.42. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on
//! Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.
//!
//! Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio
//! project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor
//! versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current
//! stable compiler version is 1.45, the minimum supported version will not be
//! increased past 1.42, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum
//! supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as
//! long as doing so complies with this policy.
