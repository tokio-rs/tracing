# 0.2.12 (August 10, 2020)

### Fixed

- **env-filter**: Incorrect max level hint when filters involving span field
  values are in use (#907)
- **registry**: Fixed inconsistent span stacks when multiple registries are in
  use on the same thread (#901)

### Changed

- **env-filter**: `regex` dependency enables fewer unused feature flags (#899)

Thanks to @bdonlan and @jeromegn for contributing to this release!

# 0.2.10 (July 31, 2020)

### Fixed

- **docs**: Incorrect formatting (#862)

### Changed

- **filter**: `LevelFilter` is now a re-export of the
  `tracing_core::LevelFilter` type, it can now be used interchangably with the
  versions in `tracing` and `tracing-core` (#853)
- **filter**: Significant performance improvements when comparing `LevelFilter`s
  and `Level`s (#853)
- Updated the minimum `tracing-core` dependency to 0.1.12 (#853)

### Added

- **filter**: `LevelFilter` and `EnvFilter` now participate in `tracing-core`'s
  max level hinting, improving performance significantly in some use cases where
  levels are disabled globally (#853)

# 0.2.9 (July 23, 2020)

### Fixed

- **fmt**: Fixed compilation failure on MSRV when the `chrono` feature is
  disabled (#844)

### Added

- **fmt**: Span lookup methods defined by `layer::Context` are now also provided
  by `FmtContext` (#834)

# 0.2.8 (July 17, 2020)

### Changed

- **fmt**: When the `chrono` dependency is enabled, the `SystemTime` timestamp
  formatter now emits human-readable timestamps rather than using `SystemTime`'s
  `fmt::Debug`implementation (`chrono` is still required for customized
  timestamp formatting) (#807)
- **ansi**: Updated `ansi_term` dependency to 0.12 (#816)

### Added

- **json**: `with_span_list` method to configure the JSON formatter to include a
  list of all spans in the current trace in formatting events (similarly to the
  text formatter) (#741) 
- **json**: `with_current_span` method to configure the JSON formatter to include
  a field for the _current_ span (the leaf of the trace) in formatted events
  (#741)
- **fmt**: `with_thread_names` and `with_thread_ids` methods to configure
  `fmt::Subscriber`s and `fmt::Layer`s to include the thread name and/or thread ID
  of the current thread when formatting events (#818)
  
Thanks to new contributors @mockersf, @keetonian, and @Pothulapati for
contributing to this release!

### Changed

- **parking_lot**: Updated the optional `parking_lot` dependency to accept the
  latest `parking_lot` version (#774)

### Fixed

  as though they were children of the current span (#767)

### Added

  entered, exited, and closed, including span durations (#761)
- Documentation clarification and improvement (#762, #769)

# 0.2.4 (April 6, 2020)

This release includes several API ergonomics improvements, including shorthand
constructors for many types, and an extension trait for initializing subscribers
using method-chaining style. Additionally, several bugs in less commonly used
`fmt` APIs were fixed.

### Added

- **fmt**: Shorthand free functions for constructing most types in `fmt`
  (including `tracing_subscriber::fmt()` to return a `SubscriberBuilder`,
  `tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()` to return a format `Layer`, etc) (#660)
- **registry**: Shorthand free function `tracing_subscriber::registry()` to
  construct a new registry (#660)
- Added `SubscriberInitExt` extension trait for more ergonomic subscriber
  initialization (#660)
  
### Changed

- **fmt**: Moved `LayerBuilder` methods to `Layer` (#655)

### Deprecated

- **fmt**: `LayerBuilder`, as `Layer` now implements all builder methods (#655)
  
### Fixed

- **fmt**: Fixed `Compact` formatter not omitting levels with
  `with_level(false)` (#657)
- **fmt**: Fixed `fmt::Layer` duplicating the fields for a new span if another
  layer has already formatted its fields (#634)
- **fmt**: Added missing space when using `record` to add new fields to a span
  that already has fields (#659)
- Updated outdated documentation (#647)


# 0.2.3 (March 5, 2020)

### Fixed

- **env-filter**: Regression where filter directives were selected in the order
  they were listed, rather than most specific first (#624)

# 0.2.2 (February 27, 2020)

### Added

- **fmt**: Added `flatten_event` to `SubscriberBuilder` (#599)
- **fmt**: Added `with_level` to `SubscriberBuilder` (#594)

# 0.2.1 (February 13, 2020)

### Changed

- **filter**: `EnvFilter` directive selection now behaves correctly (i.e. like
  `env_logger`) (#583)

### Fixed

- **filter**: Fixed `EnvFilter` incorrectly allowing less-specific filter
  directives to enable events that are disabled by more-specific filters (#583)
- **filter**: Multiple significant `EnvFilter` performance improvements,
  especially when filtering events generated by `log` records (#578, #583)
- **filter**: Replaced `BTreeMap` with `Vec` in `DirectiveSet`, improving
  iteration performance significantly with typical numbers of filter directives
  (#580)

A big thank-you to @samschlegel for lots of help with `EnvFilter` performance
tuning in this release!

### Contributers

- @pimeys for #377 and #415

# 0.1.6 (October 29, 2019)

### Added

- Add `init` and `try_init` functions to `FmtSubscriber` (#385)
- Add `ChronoUtc` and `ChronoLocal` timers, RFC 3339 support (#387)
- Add `tracing::subscriber::set_default` which sets the default
  subscriber and returns a drop guard. This drop guard will reset the
  dispatch on drop (#388).

### Fixed

- Fix default level for `EnvFilter`. Setting `RUST_LOG=target`
  previously only the `ERROR` level, while it should enable everything.
  `tracing-subscriber` now defaults to `TRACE` if no level is specified
  (#401)
- Fix `tracing-log` feature flag for init + try_init. The feature flag
  `tracing_log` was used instead of the correct `tracing-log`. As a
  result, both `tracing-log` and `tracing_log` needed to be specified in
  order to initialize the global logger. Only `tracing-log` needs to be
  specified now (#400).
