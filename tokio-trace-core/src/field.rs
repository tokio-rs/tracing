//! `Span` and `Event` key-value data.
//!
//! Spans and events may be annotated with key-value data, referred to as known
//! as _fields_. These fields consist of a mapping from a key (corresponding to
//! a `&str` but represented internally as an array index) to a `Value`.
//!
//! # `Value`s and `Subscriber`s
//!
//! `Subscriber`s consume `Value`s as fields attached to `Event`s or `Span`s.
//! The set of field keys on a given `Span` or `Event` is defined on its
//! `Metadata`. Once the span or event has been created (i.e., the `new_id` or
//! `new_span` methods on the `Subscriber` have been called), field values may
//! be added by calls to the subscriber's `record_` methods.
//!
//! `tokio_trace` represents values as either one of a set of Rust primitives
//! (`i64`, `u64`, `bool`, and `&str`) or using a `fmt::Display` or `fmt::Debug`
//! implementation. The `record_` trait functions on the `Subscriber` trait allow
//! `Subscriber` implementations to provide type-specific behaviour for
//! consuming values of each type.
//!
//! The `Subscriber` trait provides default implementations of `record_u64`,
//! `record_i64`, `record_bool`, and `record_str` which call the `record_fmt`
//! function, so that only the `record_fmt` function must be implemented.
//! However, implementors of `Subscriber` that wish to consume these primitives
//! as their types may override the `record` methods for any types they care
//! about. For example, we might record integers by incrementing counters for
//! their field names, rather than printing them.
