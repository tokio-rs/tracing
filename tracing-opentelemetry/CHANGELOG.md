# 0.17.4 (July 1, 2022)

This release adds optional support for recording `std::error::Error`s using
[OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions for exceptions][exn-semconv].

### Added

- `Layer::with_exception_fields` to enable emitting `exception.message` and
  `exception.backtrace` semantic-convention fields when an `Error` is recorded
  as a span or event field ([#2135])
- `Layer::with_exception_field_propagation` to enable setting `exception.message` and
  `exception.backtrace` semantic-convention fields on the current span when an
  event with an `Error` field is recorded ([#2135])

Thanks to @lilymara-onesignal for contributing to this release!

# 0.17.3 (June 7, 2022)

This release adds support for emitting thread names and IDs to OpenTelemetry, as
well as recording `std::error::Error` values in a structured manner with their
source chain included. Additionally, this release fixes issues related to event
and span source code locations.

### Added

- `Layer::with_threads` to enable recording thread names/IDs according to
  [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions][thread-semconv] ([#2134])
- `Error::source` chain when recording `std::error::Error` values ([#2122])
- `Layer::with_location` method (replaces `Layer::with_event_location`)
  ([#2124])

### Changed

- `std::error::Error` values are now recorded using `fmt::Display` rather than
  `fmt::Debug` ([#2122])

### Fixed

- Fixed event source code locations overwriting the parent span's source
  location ([#2099])
- Fixed `Layer::with_event_location` not controlling whether locations are
  emitted for spans as well as events ([#2124])

### Deprecated

- `Layer::with_event_location`: renamed to `Layer::with_location`, as it now
  controls both span and event locations ([#2124])

Thanks to new contributors @lilymara-onesignal, @hubertbudzynski, and @DevinCarr
for contributing to this release!
