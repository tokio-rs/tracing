//! This example demonstrates how `tracing` events can be recorded from within a
//! panic hook, capturing the span context in which the program panicked.
//!
//! A custom panic hook can also be used to record panics that are captured
//! using `catch_unwind`, such as when Tokio catches panics in spawned async
//! tasks. See the `tokio_panic_hook.rs` example for an example of this.

    // NOTE: Using `tracing` in a panic hook requires the use of the *global*
    // trace dispatcher (`tracing::collect::set_global_default`), rather than
    // the per-thread scoped dispatcher
    // (`tracing::collect::with_default`/`set_default`). With the scoped trace
    // dispatcher, the collector's thread-local context may already have been
    // torn down by unwinding by the time the panic handler is reached.

    // Set a panic hook that records the panic as a `tracing` event at the
    // `ERROR` verbosity level.
    //
    // If we are currently in a span when the panic occurred, the logged event
    // will include the current span, allowing the context in which the panic
    // occurred to be recorded.

            // On nightly Rust, where the `PanicInfo` type also exposes a
            // `message()` method returning just the message, we could record
            // just the message instead of the entire `fmt::Display`
            // implementation, avoiding the duplciated location
