#![allow(dead_code)]
//! This example shows how a field value may be recorded using the `valuable`
//! crate (https://crates.io/crates/valuable).
//!
//! `valuable` provides a lightweight but flexible way to record structured data, allowing
//! visitors to extract individual fields or elements of structs, maps, arrays, and other
//! nested structures.
//!
//! `tracing`'s support for `valuable` is currently feature flagged. Additionally, `valuable`
//! support is considered an *unstable feature*: in order to use `valuable` with `tracing`,
//! the project must be built with `RUSTFLAGS="--cfg tracing_unstable`.
//!
//! Therefore, when `valuable` support is not enabled, this example falls back to using
//! `fmt::Debug` to record fields that implement `valuable::Valuable`.
