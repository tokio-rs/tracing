//! Spans represent periods of time in which a program was executing in a
//! particular context.
//!
//! A span consists of [fields], user-defined key-value pairs of arbitrary data
//! that describe the context the span represents, and a set of fixed attributes
//! that describe all `tracing` spans and events. Attributes describing spans
//! include:
//!
//! - An [`Id`] assigned by the subscriber that uniquely identifies it in relation
//!   to other spans.
//! - The span's [parent] in the trace tree.
//! - [Metadata] that describes static characteristics of all spans
//!   originating from that callsite, such as its name, source code location,
//!   [verbosity level], and the names of its fields.
//!
//! # Creating Spans
//!
//! Spans are created using the [`span!`] macro. This macro is invoked with the
//! following arguments, in order:
//!
//! - The [`target`] and/or [`parent`][parent] attributes, if the user wishes to
//!   override their default values.
//! - The span's [verbosity level]
//! - A string literal providing the span's name.
//! - Finally, between zero and 32 arbitrary key/value fields.
//!
//! [`target`]: super::Metadata::target()
//!
//! For example:
//! ```rust
//! use tracing::{span, Level};
//!
//! /// Construct a new span at the `INFO` level named "my_span", with a single
//! /// field named answer , with the value `42`.
//! let my_span = span!(Level::INFO, "my_span", answer = 42);
//! ```
//!
//! The documentation for the [`span!`] macro provides additional examples of
//! the various options that exist when creating spans.
//!
//! The [`trace_span!`], [`debug_span!`], [`info_span!`], [`warn_span!`], and
//! [`error_span!`] exist as shorthand for constructing spans at various
//! verbosity levels.
//!
//! ## Recording Span Creation
//!
//! The [`Attributes`] type contains data associated with a span, and is
//! provided to the [collector] when a new span is created. It contains
//! the span's metadata, the ID of [the span's parent][parent] if one was
//! explicitly set, and any fields whose values were recorded when the span was
//! constructed. The collector, which is responsible for recording `tracing`
//! data, can then store or record these values.
//!
//! # The Span Lifecycle
//!
//! ## Entering a Span
//!
//! A thread of execution is said to _enter_ a span when it begins executing,
//! and _exit_ the span when it switches to another context. Spans may be
//! entered through the [`enter`] and [`in_scope`] methods.
//!
//! The `enter` method enters a span, returning a [guard] that exits the span
//! when dropped
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{Level, span};
//! let my_var: u64 = 5;
//! let my_span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my_span", my_var);
//!
//! // `my_span` exists but has not been entered.
//!
//! // Enter `my_span`...
//! let _enter = my_span.enter();
//!
//! // Perform some work inside of the context of `my_span`...
//! // Dropping the `_enter` guard will exit the span.
//!```
//!
//! <div class="example-wrap" style="display:inline-block"><pre class="compile_fail" style="white-space:normal;font:inherit;">
//!
//!  **Warning**: In asynchronous code that uses async/await syntax,
//!  [`Span::enter`] may produce incorrect traces if the returned drop
//!  guard is held across an await point. See
//!  [the method documentation][Span#in-asynchronous-code] for details.
//!
//! </pre></div>
//!
//! `in_scope` takes a closure or function pointer and executes it inside the
//! span.
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{Level, span};
//! let my_var: u64 = 5;
//! let my_span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my_span", my_var = &my_var);
//!
//! my_span.in_scope(|| {
//!     // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//! });
//!
//! // Perform some work outside of the context of `my_span`...
//!
//! my_span.in_scope(|| {
//!     // Perform some more work in the context of `my_span`.
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! <div class="example-wrap" style="display:inline-block">
//! <pre class="ignore" style="white-space:normal;font:inherit;">
//! <strong>Note</strong>: Since entering a span takes <code>&self</code>, and
//! <code>Span</code>s are <code>Clone</code>, <code>Send</code>, and
//! <code>Sync</code>, it is entirely valid for multiple threads to enter the
//! same span concurrently.
//! </pre></div>
//!
//! ## Span Relationships
//!
//! Spans form a tree structure â€” unless it is a root span, all spans have a
//! _parent_, and may have one or more _children_. When a new span is created,
//! the current span becomes the new span's parent. The total execution time of
//! a span consists of the time spent in that span and in the entire subtree
//! represented by its children. Thus, a parent span always lasts for at least
//! as long as the longest-executing span in its subtree.
//!
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{Level, span};
//! // this span is considered the "root" of a new trace tree:
//! span!(Level::INFO, "root").in_scope(|| {
//!     // since we are now inside "root", this span is considered a child
//!     // of "root":
//!     span!(Level::DEBUG, "outer_child").in_scope(|| {
//!         // this span is a child of "outer_child", which is in turn a
//!         // child of "root":
//!         span!(Level::TRACE, "inner_child").in_scope(|| {
//!             // and so on...
//!         });
//!     });
//!     // another span created here would also be a child of "root".
//! });
//!```
//!
//! In addition, the parent of a span may be explicitly specified in
//! the `span!` macro. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use tracing::{Level, span};
//! // Create, but do not enter, a span called "foo".
//! let foo = span!(Level::INFO, "foo");
//!
//! // Create and enter a span called "bar".
//! let bar = span!(Level::INFO, "bar");
//! let _enter = bar.enter();
//!
//! // Although we have currently entered "bar", "baz"'s parent span
//! // will be "foo".
//! let baz = span!(parent: &foo, Level::INFO, "baz");
//! ```
//!
//! A child span should typically be considered _part_ of its parent. For
//! example, if a collector is recording the length of time spent in various
//! spans, it should generally include the time spent in a span's children as
//! part of that span's duration.
//!
//! In addition to having zero or one parent, a span may also _follow from_ any
//! number of other spans. This indicates a causal relationship between the span
//! and the spans that it follows from, but a follower is *not* typically
//! considered part of the duration of the span it follows. Unlike the parent, a
//! span may record that it follows from another span after it is created, using
//! the [`follows_from`] method.
//!
//! As an example, consider a listener task in a server. As the listener accepts
//! incoming connections, it spawns new tasks that handle those connections. We
//! might want to have a span representing the listener, and instrument each
//! spawned handler task with its own span. We would want our instrumentation to
//! record that the handler tasks were spawned as a result of the listener task.
//! However, we might not consider the handler tasks to be _part_ of the time
//! spent in the listener task, so we would not consider those spans children of
//! the listener span. Instead, we would record that the handler tasks follow
//! from the listener, recording the causal relationship but treating the spans
//! as separate durations.
//!
//! ## Closing Spans
//!
//! Execution may enter and exit a span multiple times before that span is
//! _closed_. Consider, for example, a future which has an associated
//! span and enters that span every time it is polled:
//! ```rust
//! # use futures::{Future, Poll, Async};
//! struct MyFuture {
//!    // data
//!    span: tracing::Span,
//! }
//!
//! impl Future for MyFuture {
//!     type Item = ();
//!     type Error = ();
//!
//!     fn poll(&mut self) -> Poll<Self::Item, Self::Error> {
//!         let _enter = self.span.enter();
//!         // Do actual future work...
//! # Ok(Async::Ready(()))
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If this future was spawned on an executor, it might yield one or more times
//! before `poll` returns `Ok(Async::Ready)`. If the future were to yield, then
//! the executor would move on to poll the next future, which may _also_ enter
//! an associated span or series of spans. Therefore, it is valid for a span to
//! be entered repeatedly before it completes. Only the time when that span or
//! one of its children was the current span is considered to be time spent in
//! that span. A span which is not executing and has not yet been closed is said
//! to be _idle_.
//!
//! Because spans may be entered and exited multiple times before they close,
//! [collector]s have separate trait methods which are called to notify them
//! of span exits and when span handles are dropped. When execution exits a
//! span, [`exit`] will always be called with that span's ID to notify the
//! collector that the span has been exited. When span handles are dropped, the
//! [`drop_span`] method is called with that span's ID. The collector may use
//! this to determine whether or not the span will be entered again.
//!
//! If there is only a single handle with the capacity to exit a span, dropping
//! that handle "closes" the span, since the capacity to enter it no longer
//! exists. For example:
//! ```
//! # use tracing::{Level, span};
//! {
//!     span!(Level::TRACE, "my_span").in_scope(|| {
//!         // perform some work in the context of `my_span`...
//!     }); // --> Collect::exit(my_span)
//!
//!     // The handle to `my_span` only lives inside of this block; when it is
//!     // dropped, the collector will be informed via `drop_span`.
//!
//! } // --> Collect::drop_span(my_span)
//! ```
//!
//! However, if multiple handles exist, the span can still be re-entered even if
//! one or more is dropped. For determining when _all_ handles to a span have
//! been dropped, collectors have a [`clone_span`] method, which is called
//! every time a span handle is cloned. Combined with `drop_span`, this may be
//! used to track the number of handles to a given span â€” if `drop_span` has
//! been called one more time than the number of calls to `clone_span` for a
//! given ID, then no more handles to the span with that ID exist. The
//! collector may then treat it as closed.
//!
//! # When to use spans
//!
//! As a rule of thumb, spans should be used to represent discrete units of work
//! (e.g., a given request's lifetime in a server) or periods of time spent in a
//! given context (e.g., time spent interacting with an instance of an external
//! system, such as a database).
//!
//! Which scopes in a program correspond to new spans depend somewhat on user
//! intent. For example, consider the case of a loop in a program. Should we
//! construct one span and perform the entire loop inside of that span, like:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use tracing::{Level, span};
//! # let n = 1;
//! let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my_loop");
//! let _enter = span.enter();
//! for i in 0..n {
//!     # let _ = i;
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
//! Or, should we create a new span for each iteration of the loop, as in:
//! ```rust
//! # use tracing::{Level, span};
//! # let n = 1u64;
//! for i in 0..n {
//!     let span = span!(Level::TRACE, "my_loop", iteration = i);
//!     let _enter = span.enter();
//!     // ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Depending on the circumstances, we might want to do either, or both. For
//! example, if we want to know how long was spent in the loop overall, we would
//! create a single span around the entire loop; whereas if we wanted to know how
//! much time was spent in each individual iteration, we would enter a new span
//! on every iteration.

    /// point, the current scope is _exited_, but values in that scope are

    /// execution from that await point). This means that _another_ task will
    /// begin executing while _remaining_ in the entered span. This results in
    /// an incorrect trace.
    ///
    /// Instead of using `Span::enter` in asynchronous code, prefer the
    /// following:
    ///
    /// * To enter a span for a synchronous section of code within an async
    ///   block or function, prefer [`Span::in_scope`]. Since `in_scope` takes a
    ///   synchronous closure and exits the span when the closure returns, the
    ///   span will always be exited before the next await point. For example:
    ///   ```
    ///   # use tracing::info_span;
    ///   # async fn some_other_async_function(_: ()) {}
    ///   async fn my_async_function() {
    ///       let span = info_span!("my_async_function");
    ///
    ///       let some_value = span.in_scope(|| {
    ///           // run some synchronous code inside the span...
    ///       });
    ///
    ///       // This is okay! The span has already been exited before we reach
    ///       // the await point.
    ///       some_other_async_function(some_value).await;
    ///
    ///       // ...
    ///   }
    ///   ```
    /// * For instrumenting asynchronous code, `tracing` provides the
    ///   [`Future::instrument` combinator][instrument] for
    ///   attaching a span to a future (async function or block). This will
    ///   enter the span _every_ time the future is polled, and exit it whenever
    ///   the future yields.
    ///
    ///   `Instrument` can be used with an async block inside an async function:
    ///   ```ignore
    ///   # use tracing::info_span;
    ///   use tracing::Instrument;
    ///
    ///   # async fn some_other_async_function() {}
    ///   async fn my_async_function() {
    ///       let span = info_span!("my_async_function");
    ///       async move {
    ///          // This is correct! If we yield here, the span will be exited,
    ///          // and re-entered when we resume.

    ///         // ...and await it.
    ///         .await
    ///   }
    ///   ```
    ///
    ///   It can also be used to instrument calls to async functions at the
