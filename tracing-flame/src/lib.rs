//! A Tracing [Subscriber][`FlameSubscriber`] for generating a folded stack trace for generating flamegraphs
//! and flamecharts with [`inferno`]
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! [`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
//! scoped, structured, and async-aware diagnostics. `tracing-flame` provides helpers
//! for consuming `tracing` instrumentation that can later be visualized as a
//! flamegraph/flamechart. Flamegraphs/flamecharts are useful for identifying performance
//! issues bottlenecks in an application. For more details, see Brendan Gregg's [post]
//! on flamegraphs.
//!
//! *Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.56+][msrv]*
//!
//! [msrv]: #supported-rust-versions
//! [post]: http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! This crate is meant to be used in a two step process:
//!
//! 1. Capture textual representation of the spans that are entered and exited
//!    with [`FlameSubscriber`].
//! 2. Feed the textual representation into `inferno-flamegraph` to generate the
//!    flamegraph or flamechart.
//!
//! *Note*: when using a buffered writer as the writer for a `FlameSubscriber`, it is necessary to
//! ensure that the buffer has been flushed before the data is passed into
//! [`inferno-flamegraph`]. For more details on how to flush the internal writer
//! of the `FlameSubscriber`, see the docs for [`FlushGuard`].
//!
//! ## Subscriber Setup
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::{fs::File, io::BufWriter};
//! use tracing_flame::FlameSubscriber;
//! use tracing_subscriber::{registry::Registry, prelude::*, fmt};
//!
//! fn setup_global_subscriber() -> impl Drop {
//!     let fmt_subscriber = fmt::Subscriber::default();
//!
//!     let (flame_subscriber, _guard) = FlameSubscriber::with_file("./tracing.folded").unwrap();
//!
//!     let collector = Registry::default()
//!         .with(fmt_subscriber)
//!         .with(flame_subscriber);
//!
//!     tracing::collect::set_global_default(collector).expect("Could not set global default");
//!     _guard
//! }
//!
//! // your code here ..
//! ```
//!
//! As an alternative, you can provide _any_ type that implements `std::io::Write` to
//! `FlameSubscriber::new`.
//!
//! ## Generating the Image
//!
//! To convert the textual representation of a flamegraph to a visual one, first install `inferno`:
//!
//! ```console
//! cargo install inferno
//! ```
//!
//! Then, pass the file created by `FlameLayer` into `inferno-flamegraph`:
//!
//! ```console
//! # flamegraph
//! cat tracing.folded | inferno-flamegraph > tracing-flamegraph.svg
//!
//! # flamechart
//! cat tracing.folded | inferno-flamegraph --flamechart > tracing-flamechart.svg
//! ```
//!
//! ## Differences between `flamegraph`s and `flamechart`s
//!
//! By default, `inferno-flamegraph` creates flamegraphs. Flamegraphs operate by
//! that collapsing identical stack frames and sorting them on the frame's names.
//!
//! This behavior is great for multithreaded programs and long-running programs
//! where the same frames occur _many_ times, for short durations, because it reduces
//! noise in the graph and gives the reader a better idea of the
//! overall time spent in each part of the application.
//!
//! However, it is sometimes desirable to preserve the _exact_ ordering of events
//! as they were emitted by `tracing-flame`, so that it is clear when each
//! span is entered relative to others and get an accurate visual trace of
//! the execution of your program. This representation is best created with a
//! _flamechart_, which _does not_ sort or collapse identical stack frames.
//!

//! [`inferno-flamegraph`]: https://docs.rs/inferno/0.9.5/inferno/index.html#producing-a-flame-graph
//!
//! ## Supported Rust Versions
//!
//! Tracing is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
//! version is 1.56. The current Tracing version is not guaranteed to build on
//! Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.
//!
//! Tracing follows the same compiler support policies as the rest of the Tokio
//! project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor
//! versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current
//! stable compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be
//! increased past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum
//! supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as
//! long as doing so complies with this policy.

/// The output of `FlameSubscriber` emulates the output of commands like `perf` once

/// ```sh
/// perf record --call-graph dwarf target/release/mybin
/// perf script | inferno-collapse-perf > stacks.folded
/// ```
///
/// # Sample Counts
///
/// Because `tracing-flame` doesn't use sampling, the number at the end of each

/// # Dropping and Flushing
///
/// If you use a global collector the drop implementations on your various
/// subscribers will not get called when your program exits. This means that if

/// you're not guaranteed to see all the events that have been emitted in the
/// file by default.
///
/// To ensure all data is flushed when the program exits, `FlameSubscriber` exposes
/// the [`flush_on_drop`] function, which returns a [`FlushGuard`]. The `FlushGuard`
/// will flush the writer when it is dropped. If necessary, it can also be used to manually
/// flush the writer.
